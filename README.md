# 🌊 Project DeepWave — hack-enshmirtz HACKATHON PROJECT 🚀
[🌐 **Official Website**](https://project-deepwave-taupe.vercel.app/)

## ✨ **Hey Judges! THE TOUR MODE IS ON!**  
## This Feature Friday, we're bringing you our most **immersive**, **fun**, and honestly *emotional* update yet. We've worked a lot on how to elevate the overall experience of the user, and a part of our endeavour to make the experince MEMORABLE, which serves as a method to RAISE awareness 

> Predicting tsunamis is critical — but *understanding and raising awareness* them? That's what truly saves lives.  
> We want this project to *teach*, *inspire*, and maybe even help save someone’s village someday. 💙🌊

**Small note for judges** - Our ML model frontend-backend connection is coming in our next Feature Friday!
##**🌊 Till then, please do enjoy our LATEST FEATURE FRIDAY "Tour Mode" on our website with volume UP! 🚀**

**Along with enhancement of the overall UI/UX to match it with the hack-enshmirtz theme, a 2d Map, more features...
We've also added automation for the globe - that is
👉 When you click the globe, you can just click generate prediction, and it will AUTO scroll to the prediction arena...where it will auto enter the data...**
👉 Now,our ML model frontend-backend connection is coming in our next Feature Friday, but in addition to TOUR mode, we have also added this feature - to increase convinience of an aveage user. 
👉 Along with our Tour mode, we have also added a fun quiz - to make the entire experience memorable...because when you're made to think and maybe even laugh, you tend to rememebr the experience better :)
👉**Trying to put attention to detail for overall user expereince :))**

## 🛸 TOUR MODE — Immersive, Fun, and Unforgettable

The brand-new **Tour Mode** is an elevator-style scroll journey across history’s biggest tsunamis:

- 🚟 6 Levels: 5 iconic tsunami disasters + a fun interactive quiz
- ⛱️ Real images, emotional context, floating fun fact clouds
- 😍 Audio effects, black screen transitions, rain sounds, and atmospheric music
- 🎮 A dramatic quiz section ("What’s the best way to survive a tsunami?") to reinforce safety + make it fun
- 🚀 Memorable moments designed for **kids, families, future scientists** and all curious minds

> "We want a 12-year-old to scroll through and say: *'Whoa... this was real?'*"

Tour Mode is more than a feature—it's a tribute, a lesson, and an experience.

## 🌿 Educating Through Real Events

We also use DeepWave to teach people about **real tsunami disasters**. 

- 🔹 1960 Chilean Earthquake (M9.5)  
- 🔹 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami  
- 🔹 2011 Tōhoku, Japan  
- 🔹 1755 Lisbon, Portugal  
- 🔹 1883 Krakatoa eruption  

> These aren't just events. They're *why* we build this.

By learning from the past, we build tools that might protect the future.


## 🌐 What is DeepWave?

**DeepWave** is a web app designed to help researchers, disaster-response teams, and anyone concerned with **predicting tsunami risk at any coastal location**.

It combines:

- 👉 A **machine learning model** that predicts tsunami likelihood from coordinates  
- 👉 An **interactive 3D NASA Earth globe** so users can **visually choose precise locations** instead of manually searching for latitude and longitude  
- 👉 A brand-new immersive **Tour Mode** to educate users about historical tsunami events in a fun, emotional way

Our mission:

> **"Making critical geolocation data entry accessible and intuitive — for those moments when precision can save lives."**

## 🌟 About the Site

DeepWave is built to **predict tsunami risk** using precise geographic coordinates.

Normally, teams have to manually look up and type latitude and longitude—slow and error-prone, especially during emergencies.

Our **Interactive Globe** changes that:

- 🌍 Spin, zoom, and explore Earth in 3D  
- 📍 Click *exactly* where you want to analyze  
- 📏 Instantly see **precise WGS84 coordinates**  

These coordinates will be **fed into our tsunami prediction ML model** (integration planned), returning risk scores in real-time.

It's not just functional—it's *engaging*, helping users better understand coastal geography and plan proactively.

## 📈 AI Model & Future Integration

- ⏳ ML backend model has **91% accuracy**  
- 📊 Inputs: latitude, longitude, magnitude, depth
- 🌐 Currently under **integration with frontend** — will go live in the next Feature Friday!

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# 1️⃣ Clone this repo
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# 2️⃣ Go to the project folder
cd wavefront

# 3️⃣ Install dependencies
npm install

# 4️⃣ Start the development server
npm run dev
```

---

## 🌍 Core Features

- 👉 Interactive 3D Earth using NASA imagery
- 👉 Click to get precise latitude and longitude (WGS84)
- 👉 Smooth bounce animation centered on click location
- 👉 Real-time coordinate display
- 👉 Mobile-friendly & responsive

---

## 🌌 Why This Globe is Special

- Uses NASA 4K Blue Marble textures for realism
- Handles 3D-to-geographic projection and rotation
- Click mapping using inverse rotation matrices
- Custom sinusoidal bounce animations (no prebuilt libs!)

---

## ✨ Highlights of Implementation
