This Feature Friday is about bringing **people into the loop** — because your senses might detect the next big wave before the sensors do.

> **Machines predict. Humans feel. Together, we alert better.**

When you visit DeepWave now, you can report unusual phenomena you experience — and view real-time reports submitted by others, all from your phone. Here's what we built:

**We've really given our best, collaboration on live reporting happens to one of the least touched areas when it comes to disaster management. Hence Disaster Alertinator came up with this very cool feature. this feautre has a lot of scope, we explored one important path of it - that is reporting live observations! Giving our users a platform to get awareness and contrinbute actively is our goal, which we hope to have achieved with this feature friday :)**

## 🛰️ **FEATURE FRIDAY: Real-Time Community Reporting System**

Let users on the ground directly report events like:

- "I felt an earthquake."
- "Water is pulling away from the beach!"
- "Weird animal activity..."
- 🖼️ Optional photo upload + live timestamp & location

### 🗺️ Interactive Map Integration (Powered by React Leaflet):
- Submitted reports are instantly mapped using **real geolocation**
- Each report appears as a **clickable map pin**
- Pins display the **type of observation**, **user message**, and **timestamp**
- Map updates in **real time**, and is visible on the homepage
- Highlights **community-generated early warning zones**

### 🔘 Choose From 3 Event Types:
- 🌍 Earthquake Felt  
- 🌊 Unusual Water Movement  
- 🐦 Animal Noise/Movement

### 🛡️ Safety & Trust:
- Only **registered users** can submit reports
- Reports are sanitized, rate-limited, and timestamped
- Designed to help **early warning cross-validation** with live data

> *“We're making disaster awareness more participatory, human, and fast.”*
