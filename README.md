## ✨ **Hey Judges! THE TOUR MODE IS ON!**  
**This Feature Friday, our biggest, most emotional, and most *immersive* update yet is LIVE.**  
We've designed it to **teach**, **inspire**, and *raise awareness* about tsunamis in a way that's truly **memorable**.

> **Immersive. Memorable. Creating Awareness — but in a Fun Way.**

When you visit our site, please **start with Tour Mode (volume up!)**. It’s not just a feature—it’s an experience designed to make you *feel* the stories of real disasters.

## 🛸 🌟 **FOCUS FEATURE: TOUR MODE** — Immersive, Fun, and Unforgettable

Tour Mode is a **scroll-driven elevator journey** through history’s most devastating tsunamis:

- 🚟 6 Levels: 5 real historical tsunami disasters + an interactive safety quiz
- 🖼️ Real images, dramatic transitions, floating fact clouds
- 🎶 Audio: thunderstorm, rain sounds, immersive music
- 🧠 A quiz to reinforce safety knowledge in a **fun** way

> “We want a 12-year-old to scroll through and say: *‘Whoa… this was real?’*”

It’s designed to **educate**, **move**, and **stick** in the mind—because awareness is what saves lives.

## 🌿 **Educational Through Real Events**

DeepWave’s Tour Mode spotlights **real historical tsunamis** to teach lessons that matter:

- 1960 Chilean Earthquake (M9.5)
- 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami
- 2011 Tōhoku, Japan
- 1755 Lisbon, Portugal
- 1883 Krakatoa eruption

> These aren’t just events. They’re *why* we’re building this.

## ⚡️ **Beyond Tour Mode: Other Enhancements**
Alongside Tour Mode, we've also focused on **overall UX/UI improvements** in line with the hack-enshmirtz theme, adding more features and details to make DeepWave intuitive and accessible:

- 🌍 **Interactive 3D NASA Earth Globe**  
  - Spin, zoom, and **click to select precise coordinates**
  - View instantly displayed WGS84 coordinates
  - Realistic NASA textures with custom bounce animation
- 🗺️ **New 2D Map View**  
  - Easier for certain users to navigate
- 🤖 **Automation Features**  
  - Click **Generate Prediction** to auto-scroll to the prediction arena
  - Auto-fill example data (while waiting for ML integration)
- 🧩 **Integrated Quiz Outside Tour Mode**  
  - Even outside the elevator journey, users can test their tsunami knowledge
  - Reinforces learning through interactivity
- 🌱 **Attention to Detail**  
  - Smoother transitions, atmospheric effects, and thoughtful copy throughout

> **We're trying to make this experience *convenient*, *memorable*, and *meaningful*.**
