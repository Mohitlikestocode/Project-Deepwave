# 🌊 Project DeepWave — hack-enshmirtz HACKATHON PROJECT 🚀

 #✨ **Hey Judges! THE TOUR MODE IS ON!**  
 
> This Feature Friday, we're bringing you our most **immersive**, **fun**, and honestly *emotional* update yet.  
> Predicting tsunamis is critical — but *understanding* them? That's what truly saves lives.  
> We want this project to *teach*, *inspire*, and maybe even help save someone’s village someday. 💙🌊

**Small note for judges - Our ML model frontend backened connection would be coming in our next Feature Friday..**  
# 🌊 Till then, please do enjoy our LATEST FEATURE FRIDAY "Tour mode" on our website with volume UP ;)🚀
##Apart from putting efforts on the website UI, to match the theme of our hackathon hack-enshmirtz, making the UI clean, memorable, We have introduced TOUR MODE!!

## 🎢 🎭 **TOUR MODE — Our Biggest Innovation Yet!**

We realized our goal isn't just to predict tsunamis — it's to help people really **feel** why they matter.  

**What's Tour Mode?**  
It’s not just a feature. It’s a *journey*.  
An *elevator-style adventure* through history’s worst tsunami events, with real images, real stories, and even a quiz to make sure you remember the important stuff.  

🌌 **Highlights:**  
- Elevator navigation through 6 levels — 5 historic disasters + 1 interactive quiz  
- Black screen transitions with lines like *“It’s time for a journey”* and *“Welcome to Disaster Alertinator”*  
- Atmospheric rain sounds and music (yes, even a cheeky Phineas and Ferb-inspired theme in the background 😉)  
- Fun fact clouds floating by with real tsunami data and AI insights  
- Designed for *everyone*: kids, families, students, future scientists  

We want a 12-year-old to click this and say:  
> *“Whoa… this was real?”*  

And then take the quiz, laugh at the options, but remember the right answer *for life*.  

Because someday, this might not just be a school project — it might **save lives**.

## 🌐 **What is DeepWave?**

DeepWave is a web app designed to help researchers, disaster-response teams, or anyone worried about coastal risk **predict tsunamis** more easily and intuitively.  

We combine:  
🌍 An **interactive 3D NASA Earth globe** so you can *visually* choose precise locations  
🧠 A **machine learning model** with 91% accuracy for tsunami prediction  (UPCOMING FEATURE FRIDAY)
🎢 And now — **TOUR MODE** for immersive awareness and education  

> Our mission: *Making life-saving tools accessible, intuitive, and even a little fun.*

## 💡 **Why We Built This**

> *"To predict tsunami risk accurately, you need the exact coastal coordinates. But in an emergency, no one wants to scramble with Google Maps."*  

We wanted to make it:  
✨ Easy  
🌎 Visual  
🚀 Fast  
❤️ Human  

But we didn’t stop there.  

We want users to *understand* what these waves have done.  
To *respect* the tragedies behind the numbers.  
To *never forget* why early warning systems matter.  

It’s not just tech. It’s *personal*.

## 📚 **Educating Through Experience**

We want DeepWave to do more than predict.  
We want it to *teach*.  

When you explore Tour Mode:  
🌊 You see the human cost.  
📖 You read real stories.  
🎶 You hear the rain and music that set the tone.  
❓ You take the quiz and (hopefully) remember the right answer forever.  

> “Because someday, that answer might save someone’s village.”

## ⚡ **Special Notes for Hackathon Reviewers**

We’re so grateful that our **Interactive NASA Globe** won a previous Feature Friday!  

This time, we wanted to bring *that level of creativity* to the **whole experience**.  

✨ TOUR MODE is the heart of this update.  
We hope you’ll explore it, hear the sound, see the images, take the quiz, and understand why it matters to us so much.  

✅ Next Feature Friday: **Full ML model integration into frontend** — click the globe, see the risk instantly.
