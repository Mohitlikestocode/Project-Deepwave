## 🎓 Inspired by Node.js & Authorization Workshop with Manan & Rohit!
Huge shoutout to **Manan** and **Rohit** for their Node.js and Authorization session, We were so fired up by the ideas they shared that we couldn't just sit still — so we brought robust, **Perry-style authentication** to DeepWave! Couldn't think it was possible, but after the session we did it. Supbase - nodjs connection :)) 

And in addition, the GAME MODE! (Played way too long lol...enjoy the two songs you can put while you're on the game ;))
Because **awareness isn't just about data and numbers.** It's about creating an *experience* that people remember.  
Something that says:

> *"Disaster Alertinator’s got your back when it comes to tsunamis!"*
