## ✨ **Hey Judges! OUR LATEST FEATURE FRIDAY IS ALMOST LIVE!** 📱🛰️  
### 🌟 **FEATURE FRIDAY: Real-Time Community Reporting + Fully Responsive Mobile Layout**  
*(Test it out on your phone — and try submitting a live report!)*

This Feature Friday is about bringing **people into the loop** — because your senses might detect the next big wave before the sensors do.

> **Machines predict. Humans feel. Together, we alert better.**

When you visit DeepWave now, you can report unusual phenomena you experience — and view real-time reports submitted by others, all from your phone. Here's what we built:

---

## 🛰️ **FEATURE FRIDAY: Real-Time Community Reporting System**

Let users on the ground directly report events like:

- "I felt an earthquake."
- "Water is pulling away from the beach!"
- "Weird animal activity..."
- 🖼️ Optional photo upload + live timestamp & location

All reports are visible live on the **main home page** — creating a crowdsourced warning system to supplement tech-based prediction.

### 🛡️ Safety & Trust:
- Only **registered users** can submit reports
- Reports are sanitized, rate-limited, and timestamped
- Designed to help **early warning cross-validation** with live data

> *“We're making disaster awareness more participatory, human, and fast.”*

---

## 📱 **FEATURE FRIDAY: Fully Responsive Mobile Layout**

Emergencies happen on-the-go — so we redesigned DeepWave to **work beautifully on mobile**.

### 🔧 What We Improved:
- 🔄 Fully responsive layout across all screen sizes
- 🧭 Mobile-friendly Tour Mode & Game Mode
- 🎮 Perry Tsunami Game now plays flawlessly with touch controls
- 🖱️ Smooth navigation, improved spacing & font scaling

### 🔍 Fixes We Faced:
- 📸 Broken layouts on small devices — fixed with dynamic breakpoints
- 🧩 Modal glitches solved with updated triggers
- ⚠️ Mobile image uploads & live reporting UI now polished and fast

> *"Whether you're reporting a disaster or just exploring our game — your phone can now do it all."*
